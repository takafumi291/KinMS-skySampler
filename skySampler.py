# Second build of SkySampler. This program now includes multiple routines - the main, most-costly,
# sampling algorithm and the lightweight transformation program, which rotates the 
# sky-coordinates of clouds to the galaxy plane

# A typical calling order would be to supply the datacube or moment 0, then:
#    clouds = sampleClouds(cube)
#    clouds = transformClouds(clouds, posAng = posAng, inc = inc, cent = cent)
#    clouds = sampleDisc(clouds, discThick, sbRad = rad)
#    modelCube = KinMS(<Blah>, inClouds = clouds[:,0:3], flux_clouds = clouds[:,3])

# Modifications:
# v2. December 2017, MDS, Oxford
# Testing and correction 25 December 2017, MDS, Horsham
# Updated for Python 3 compatibility 26 December 2017, MDS, Horsham
# Bug fixing for odd dimensioned cubes, added temprorary assertion to require square inputs, 25 June 2019, MDS, Oxford
